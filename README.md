<p align="left"># 🏫 School Management System  <br><br>A web-based **School Management System** built with **ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework Core, and Identity** to streamline academic and administrative tasks.  <br><br>The system allows schools to manage students, teachers, classes, fees, and transportation in an efficient and user-friendly way.  <br><br>---<br><br>## 📌 Key Features<br>- 👤 **User Management** – Registration, login, profile management, and role-based permissions.  <br>- 🎓 **Students & Teachers** – Add, update, and track student and teacher records.  <br>- 📝 **Grades & Subjects** – Manage academic levels, subjects, and student performance.  <br>- 💰 **Fees Management** – Track total fees, amounts paid, and outstanding balances.  <br>- 🚌 **Transportation (Buses)** – Manage school buses and student assignments.  <br>- 📊 **Dashboard & Reports** – View statistics such as total students, fees collected, remaining balances, and more.  <br>- 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization** – Built with **ASP.NET Identity** for secure access control.  <br><br>---<br><br>## 🛠️ Tech Stack<br>- **Backend:** ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Identity  <br>- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5, jQuery  <br>- **Database:** SQL Server   <br>## 🏗️ Architecture<br><br>The **School Management System** follows a **Clean Architecture** approach, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.  <br><br>
### 🔹 Layers<br><br>1. **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**  <br>   - Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  <br>   - Provides responsive UI using **Bootstrap 5**.  <br>   - Communicates with the backend via **AJAX/REST APIs**.  <br><br>2. **Application Layer (Business Logic)**  <br>   - Contains the core logic and use cases of the system.  <br>   - Implements **Services** to handle operations like managing students, teachers, and fees.  <br>   - Uses **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** to pass data between layers.  <br><br>3. **Domain Layer**  <br>   - Defines the **Entities** (Students, Teachers, Classes, Fees, Users, etc.).  <br>   - Holds business rules and validation.  <br><br>4. **Infrastructure Layer (Data Access)**  <br>   - Implemented using **Entity Framework Core** with **SQL Server**.  <br>   - Repository Pattern for CRUD operations.  <br>   - Supports Stored Procedures for complex queries and reporting.  <br><br>5. **Security & Authentication**  <br>   - Implemented using **ASP.NET Identity**.  <br>   - Supports **role-based and permission-based access control**.  <br><br>---<br><br>
### 🔹 Flow Example<br>- The **frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)** sends a request (AJAX/REST) →  <br>- The **controller** receives the request and calls the **Service Layer** →  <br>- The **Service Layer** applies business rules and interacts with the **Repository** →  <br>- The **Repository** fetches or updates data from **SQL Server** →  <br>- Response is sent back to the **frontend** and displayed to the user.  <br><br>---<br><br>✅ This architecture makes the system **scalable, testable, and easy to extend** (e.g., integrating Angular, React, or a mobile app in the future).</p>
